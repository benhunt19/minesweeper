# **MINESWEEPER Game**
The file **MINESWEEPER** is a fully working Minesweeper game. It allows you to select points on a grid and flag potential mine locations without selecting them.

# **MINESWEEPER with SQL Integration**
The file **MINESWEEPER_sql** is the same game, but with a leaderboard and high scores implemented using **PostgreSQL**.  
This will not work here, as the saved data is stored on my computer. However, it is included to demonstrate how the leaderboard functionality has been integrated.  
It will even show your personal high score when you enter your name.
