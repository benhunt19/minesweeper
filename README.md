# the file MINESWEEPER is a fully working minesweeper game, selecting points on a grid and flagging where the mines are without selecting them
# the file MINESWEEPER_sql is the same game but with a leaderboard and highscores etc. This was done using PostgreSQL. This will not work on here as the saved data is on my computer, however it is here to demonstrate how it has been implemented using a leaderboard. It will even tell you your personal highscore when you enter your name
